**Zečići** (translated as "Bunnies") is a fast-paced, competitive platformer game designed for 2-4 players on a single PC. Inspired by games like *Fireboy and Watergirl* even though its not similar in tearms of gameplay, this game challenges players to outlast their opponents as they navigate an ever-rising world of randomly generated platforms.

## Gameplay

In **Zečići**, you and your friends play as adorable bunnies with one goal: **be the last bunny standing**!

### Key Features

- **Randomly Generated Platforms**: Each game is unique with randomly generated platforms that keep the gameplay fresh and unpredictable.
- **Player Interaction**: Push and bump into other players to knock them off platforms. Use strategy and timing to eliminate your competition.
- **Platform Effects**: Some platforms have special properties—like slowing down players or giving them temporary abilities.
- **Power-Ups and Items**: Collect items that can change your bunny's skin or grant you special abilities, providing a competitive edge.
